## About The Project
MedChat🤖 is an innovative RAG-based generative AI chatbot designed for inquiries regarding Indian medicines💊. Leveraging Open web data on Indian Medicines, this project was meticulously developed using Streamlit, LangChain, and the TogetherAI API, powered by Mistral-7B. Users can pose questions or seek information about medications, and MedChat, through its advanced similarity search capabilities, delivers accurate responses in most cases. The chatbot features a chat history that spans up to two conversations, enhancing user experience and facilitating seamless interactions.
